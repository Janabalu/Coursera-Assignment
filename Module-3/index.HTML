                        <p> <b> <u> Chicken and Waffles : </u> </b> <i> A Southern soul food tradition, fried chicken served with waffles and chicken gravy or butter and syrup is making the transition onto brunch and supper menus nationwide; even Chick-fil-A is testing them. There’s also a Pennsylvania Dutch version that subs in roast or stewed chicken and gravy for the fried (a great usage for extra cooked chicken). The waffles can be varied with the addition of ingredients like cornmeal or sliced scallions, making the dish easy to turn into a signature recipe. </i> </p>
                        <p> <b> <u> Fried Chicken : </u> </b> <i> The ultimate high/low chicken specialty is showing up everywhere from quick-service to specialty restaurants, where it’s often served family-style or as a Sunday blue plate special, with accompaniments like biscuits, greens, mac-and-cheese, and other homestyle sides. Brines and rubs like pickle juice, buttermilk, and mixed spice rubs not only add flavor and moisture, they also help create a signature menu item. There are even restaurants, like Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, that specialize in this food that everyone loves, but no one cooks at home. </i> </p>
                        <p> <b> <u> Butter Roast Chicken : </u> </b> <i> If you think roast chicken is roast chicken, think again. Chef-driven restaurants are upping the game with elevated takes on this favorite meal, often served for two or more, part of the “large-format” menu item trend that’s sweeping the country. At newly remodeled Tosca Cafe, in San Francisco, for instance, there’s a crowd-pleasing cooked-to-order Chicken for two served on crisp toasts with ricotta, pine nuts, and Marsala sauce. And at the NoMad in New York City, the dish to have is the stuffed roast chicken served two ways: the roasted breast, and a separate sauté-finished cocotte of dark meat, accompanied by foie gras brioche, corn, chanterelles, and the ancient grain known as freekeh. That’ll be $82 for two, please. 

                               Comfort Food. </i> </p>
                        <p> <b> <u> Chicken Soup : </u> </b> <i> The most enduringly popular soup variety of all. But beyond traditional chicken noodle and chicken rice, there are dozens of different kinds of chicken soup, running the gamut from elegant cream of chicken soup to exiting Tortilla Soup and spicy tom kha gai from Thailand, rich with chili paste and coconut milk. In fact, you could easily have a different chicken soup for every day of the month and never repeat. And even if you use a recipe that’s called chicken soup, this category represents an excellent vehicle for other healthy ingredients, including beans, greens, vegetables, and grains like barley and wheat berries. </i> </p>
                        <p> <b> <u> Chicken Sandwich : </u> </b> <i> According to restaurant research firm Food Genius, chicken is the most-featured protein in the super-hot sandwich and wrap category, at 83% and 80%, respectively, thanks to increasingly creative menuing. Examples include items like the Southwestern Baja Flatbread at KFC’s new eleven sister concept, and the Wadmalaw Chicken Sandwich at Pawleys Front Porch in South Carolina, dressed with chipotle barbecue sauce, fried pickle chips, applewood smoked bacon, and cheddar cheese. Nest Burger, which boasts of “the best chicken sandwiches in Dallas,” serves three: grilled teriyaki chicken, crispy marinated chicken breast, and pan-fried pecan crusted chicken breast. </i> </p>
